## 🌟 Overview
Welcome to the **Movie Recommendation System**! This project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** to recommend movies based on user preferences. It utilizes **cosine similarity** for content-based filtering.

## 🚀 Features
✅ **Personalized Recommendations** – Get movie suggestions based on what you like.  
✅ **Movie Posters** – See the posters of recommended movies.  
✅ **User-Friendly UI** – Built with **Streamlit** for a sleek and interactive experience.  
✅ **Efficient Processing** – Uses **TF-IDF Vectorization & Cosine Similarity** for accurate suggestions.  
✅ **Large Movie Database** – Over **5000+ movies** available for recommendations!  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- **Framework:** Streamlit 🎨  
- **Database:** TMDB API 🎞️  

## 📌 How It Works
1. **Data Processing:** The dataset is cleaned and processed.  
2. **Feature Engineering:** Movie descriptions, genres, cast, and crew are converted into meaningful tags.  
3. **Vectorization:** The **TF-IDF Vectorizer** converts text data into numerical format.  
4. **Similarity Calculation:** Cosine similarity is computed to find similar movies.  
5. **User Interaction:** The user selects a movie, and the system returns **top 5 similar movies** with posters.
